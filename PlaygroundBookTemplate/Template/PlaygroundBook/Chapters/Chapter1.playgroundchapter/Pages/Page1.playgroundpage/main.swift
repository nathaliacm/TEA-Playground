 ### We use a lot of applications these days.
 The majority of activities that we need to do are full of technology. At college, work, or even at the supermarket, we all depend on these utilities.
 
 We use applications for food delivery, buy something, talk with friends, play games, have some fun and do a lot of other things. Technology is supposed to help us all and make our lives more simple, isn't it?

 ### Let's see!
 
 * Try to make a simple activity:

      1. Click in Run my code
      2. Try to put the colored pieces in the ribbon
      3. What's happened?
      4. How did you feel about this?
