 # Let's do it!
 
 We are almost there! Let's put down the obstacles and make the technology accessible to us all.

 Another thing that we can do to make our application more accessible is to represent the information in different ways. For example, don't represent information just with text, or just with icons. It may not be clear enough.
As we can see in those examples:
  
  ![Button with icon and button with text](example.png)
 
 We can use both. It helps to better understand the information because you have different ways of receiving it.
 
 ![Button with icon and text](wrongButtonIconText.png)
  
 
 Also try to use icons that represent the action and that are real life related. Our texts need to be simple and more literal. The things must be more direct because some people with autism have difficulty understanding metaphors or instructions that are not clear.
 
 * Experiment:
 With all these in mind, try to do the activity:
 
     1. Click in Run My Code
     2. Choose the right button and help our character cross the obstacle.
