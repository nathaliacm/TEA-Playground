 # We can improve
**Did you feel disturbed because you couldn't finish the action?**

 If Neurotypical people feel disturbed with the interruption of their actions, can you imagine how people with autism feel?
 \
 Some autistic people are more sensitive to sudden changes, so they can feel more anxious and stressful and it can be unviable to use the application.

 - Note:
 If we need technology to do most things in our lives, it has to be accessible to us all, right?

 
 So, one thing that we can do to make our application more accessible is avoid interruptions on the user interaction flow. This is a simple thing and it brings benefits to all users.

 
 * Experiment:
 
     1. Click in Run My Code
     2. Try to put the colored pieces in the ribbon again.
